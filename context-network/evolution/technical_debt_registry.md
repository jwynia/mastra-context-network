# Technical Debt Registry

## Purpose
This document provides an index of all known technical debt items in the system, their impact, and remediation plans.

## Classification

### What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or expedient solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Like financial debt, technical debt incurs "interest" in the form of extra effort needed in future development.

This registry tracks known technical debt items to ensure they are:
- Explicitly documented rather than implicit
- Assessed for their impact
- Prioritized appropriately
- Addressed according to a plan

### How to Use This Registry

This registry organizes technical debt items in multiple ways to help you find relevant information:

1. **By Priority**: Find the most critical debt items to address
2. **By Area**: Find debt related to specific areas of the system
3. **By Type**: Find specific types of technical debt
4. **By Impact**: Find debt based on what aspects of the system it affects

### Technical Debt Summary

| ID | Title | Type | Priority | Area | Suggested Timeframe |
|----|-------|------|----------|------|---------------------|
| TD_001 | Workflow Data Accumulation Assumption | Architecture Debt | High | Workflows | Next Sprint |

### Technical Debt by Priority

#### Critical
- *None yet*

#### High
- **TD_001**: Workflow Data Accumulation Assumption - Developers often assume Mastra workflows accumulate data across steps like a snowball, when they actually operate on a relay race model

#### Medium
- *None yet*

#### Low
- *None yet*

### Technical Debt by Area

#### Workflows
- **TD_001**: Workflow Data Accumulation Assumption - Anti-pattern where developers expect automatic data accumulation between workflow steps

#### Component 2
- *None yet*

### Technical Debt by Type

#### Architecture Debt
- **TD_001**: Workflow Data Accumulation Assumption - Fundamental misunderstanding of Mastra's relay race workflow architecture leads to 90% of workflow failures

#### Code Debt
- *None yet*

#### Test Debt
- *None yet*

#### Documentation Debt
- *None yet*

#### Infrastructure Debt
- *None yet*

#### Process Debt
- *None yet*

### Technical Debt by Impact

#### Performance Impact
- *None yet*

#### Maintainability Impact
- *None yet*

#### Reliability Impact
- *None yet*

#### Security Impact
- *None yet*

#### Developer Experience Impact
- **TD_001**: Workflow Data Accumulation Assumption - Causes hours of debugging for what should be simple data passing issues, significantly impacting developer productivity

### Recording New Technical Debt

To record a new technical debt item:

1. Copy the template from `meta/templates/technical_debt_template.md`
2. Name the file `td_NNN_short_title.md` where NNN is the next available number
3. Fill in all sections of the template
4. Add the debt item to this registry in all relevant sections
5. Ensure the appropriate stakeholders are aware of the new debt item

### Updating Technical Debt Status

When a debt item's status changes:

1. Update the debt item document with the new status and any progress
2. Update this registry to reflect any changes in priority or categorization
3. If the debt has been fully addressed, move it to the "Addressed Debt" section with the date resolved

### Addressed Technical Debt

This section tracks debt items that have been fully addressed, serving as a record of improvements and learning opportunities.

| ID | Title | Type | Resolved Date | Resolution Summary |
|----|-------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| *None yet* |
