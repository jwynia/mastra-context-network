# ADR-001: Workflow Data Passing Strategy

## Purpose
This document records the key decision to use explicit data passing (relay race model) rather than implicit data accumulation in Mastra workflows.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Established
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Context
When designing workflow systems, a fundamental decision must be made about how data flows between sequential steps:

1. **Developer Expectations**: Most developers expect workflows to accumulate context automatically, similar to:
   - Function calls that maintain access to parent scope
   - Web frameworks that pass request context implicitly
   - State management libraries with global access patterns

2. **System Requirements**: Workflow systems need to be:
   - Predictable and debuggable
   - Testable in isolation
   - Composable and reusable
   - Performant at scale

3. **Production Experience**: Analysis of workflow failures showed that data flow confusion was the root cause of approximately 90% of runtime errors.

### Decision
Mastra workflows implement a **relay race model** where each step:
- Only receives the output of the immediately preceding step
- Must explicitly pass forward any data needed by subsequent steps
- Has no access to data from earlier steps unless explicitly passed through

### Status
Accepted

### Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- **Predictability**: Data flow is explicit and traceable through code inspection
- **Testability**: Each step can be tested in complete isolation
- **Debugging**: Clear data lineage makes debugging straightforward
- **Memory Efficiency**: No accumulation of unused data through workflow execution
- **Composability**: Steps can be reused in different workflows without hidden dependencies

**Negative consequences:**
- **Verbosity**: Developers must explicitly manage data flow with spread operators
- **Learning Curve**: Violates common developer expectations, requiring education
- **Boilerplate**: More code required for simple pass-through scenarios
- **Error Prone**: Easy to accidentally drop required data

**Risks introduced:**
- High likelihood of initial implementation errors
- Potential for developer frustration during onboarding
- Risk of workarounds that break the architectural pattern

**Trade-offs made:**
- Explicit clarity over implicit convenience
- Long-term maintainability over initial development speed
- Architectural purity over developer familiarity

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Accumulator Model
Automatically accumulate all data from previous steps, making it available to all subsequent steps.

**Pros:**
- Matches developer expectations
- Less verbose code
- No need to explicitly pass data
- Familiar programming model

**Cons:**
- Hidden dependencies between steps
- Difficult to test steps in isolation
- Memory grows with each step
- Unclear data lineage
- Potential for naming conflicts

#### Alternative 2: Hybrid Model
Allow developers to choose between relay race and accumulator modes per workflow.

**Pros:**
- Flexibility for different use cases
- Can optimize for specific scenarios
- Gradual migration path

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity
- Two mental models to maintain
- Harder to reason about workflows
- Testing becomes more complex
- Documentation burden doubled

#### Alternative 3: Context Object
Pass a shared context object through all steps that can be read and modified.

**Pros:**
- Single object to manage
- Can add middleware patterns
- Familiar to web developers

**Cons:**
- Mutable shared state
- Race conditions in parallel execution
- Harder to track data changes
- Breaks functional programming principles

### Implementation Notes

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides must be created explaining the relay race model
2. **Examples**: Provide clear examples of correct data passing patterns
3. **Tooling**: Consider development tools to validate data flow
4. **Training**: Include in onboarding materials for new developers
5. **Monitoring**: Track workflow failures related to data passing
