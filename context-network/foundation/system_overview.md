- Integration of multiple tools and services through AI orchestration
- Scalable workflow management with human-AI collaboration

**Primary Users:**
- Developers building intelligent automation systems
- Product teams requiring AI-powered features
- Operations teams automating complex workflows
- End users interacting with AI agents for task completion

### System Context

The system operates within a broader ecosystem of LLM providers, external APIs, and business systems, serving as an intelligent orchestration layer that bridges human intent with automated execution.

```

#### Key Components

The system is built around Mastra's core architectural components:

1. **Mastra Core**
   Central orchestration hub managing dependency injection, configuration, and component lifecycle

2. **Agent Layer**
   Primary abstraction for AI interactions, handling instructions, model communication, and response processing

3. **Workflow Engine**
   Step-based execution system supporting complex processes with branching, looping, and parallel execution

4. **Tool System**
   Dynamic tool composition and execution framework enabling agents to interact with external systems

5. **Memory System**
   Conversation persistence and semantic recall capabilities for context-aware interactions

6. **OpenRouter Integration**
   Model provider abstraction layer handling authentication, rate limiting, and model selection

### Key Workflows

The system supports several primary interaction patterns:

#### Agent Conversation Workflow
