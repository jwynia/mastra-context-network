### Component Overview

The system is composed of the following major components specific to Mastra-based LLM agent projects:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    %% Core Mastra Components
    Mastra[Mastra Core]
    Mastra --> Agents[Agents]
    Mastra --> Tools[Tools]
    Mastra --> Workflows[Workflows]
    Mastra --> Memory[Memory Management]
    
    %% Agent Components
    Agents --> Agent1[Task Agent]
    Agents --> Agent2[Analysis Agent]
    Agents --> Agent3[Custom Agents]
    
    %% Tool Components
    Tools --> Tool1[File System Tool]
    Tools --> Tool2[API Tool]
    Tools --> Tool3[Custom Tools]
    
    %% Workflow Components
    Workflows --> WF1[Sequential Workflows]
    Workflows --> WF2[Branching Workflows]
    Workflows --> WF3[Parallel Workflows]
    
    %% Memory Providers
    Memory --> Mem1[Redis Memory]
    Memory --> Mem2[Thread Memory]
    Memory --> Mem3[Semantic Memory]
    
    %% External Integrations
    Mastra --> OpenRouter[OpenRouter API]
    Mastra --> ExtTools[External Tools]
    
    %% Cross-cutting Concerns
    CC[Cross-cutting Concerns]
    CC --> CC1[Error Handling]
    CC --> CC2[Logging]
    CC --> CC3[Schema Validation]
    CC --> CC4[Configuration]
    
    CC1 -.-> Agents
    CC1 -.-> Tools
    CC1 -.-> Workflows
    
    CC3 -.-> Agents
    CC3 -.-> Tools
    CC3 -.-> Workflows
```

### Workflow Components

Workflow components orchestrate multi-step agent operations using a **relay race data flow model**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    WF[Workflows] --> S1[Step 1]
    WF --> S2[Step 2]
    WF --> S3[Step 3]
    S1 --> A[Agents]
    S2 --> T[Tools]
    S3 --> A
    
    S1 -.->|"Data Output 1"| S2
    S2 -.->|"Data Output 2"| S3
```

**Key Aspects:**
- Step-based execution model with explicit data passing
- **Critical:** Each step only receives the previous step's output (relay race model)
- Conditional branching support
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Error handling and recovery

**Data Flow Considerations:**
- Steps must explicitly pass data forward using spread operators
- No automatic context accumulation between steps
- See [Workflow Data Flow Patterns](../cross_cutting/mastra_workflow_patterns.md) for critical guidance
