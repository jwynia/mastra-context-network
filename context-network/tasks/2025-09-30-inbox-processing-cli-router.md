### Phase 1: CLI Router Implementation ✅

#### CLI Router Created (`scripts/cli.ts`)
**Location**: `scripts/cli.ts` (200 lines)

**Features Implemented**:
- Cliffy command framework integration (v1.0.0-rc.4)
- Main application command with metadata
- Global options:
  - `--verbose` / `-v`: Enable verbose logging
  - `--json`: JSON output mode
  - `--output <file>`: Write to file
- Command registration pattern
- Help system with examples
- Version display

**Commands Registered**:
- `scan`: Codebase scanning
- `query`: Semantic graph queries
- `doctor`: Health check
- `db`: Database management (init, stats)
- `analyze`: Comprehensive analysis (placeholder)
- `watch`: File watching (placeholder)

#### Command Updates

**scan.ts** (`scripts/commands/scan.ts`):
- Added Cliffy Command export `scanCommand`
- Maintained backward compatibility with direct execution
- Options mapped correctly to ScanOptions interface
- Examples added for help system

**query.ts** (`scripts/commands/query.ts`):
- Added Cliffy Command export `queryCommand`
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Template system integrated
- Format options working

#### Configuration Updates

**deno.json**:
- Updated all tasks to route through `scripts/cli.ts`
- Consistent command interface:
  ```json
  "scan": "deno run -A scripts/cli.ts scan"
  "query": "deno run -A scripts/cli.ts query"
  "doctor": "deno run -A scripts/cli.ts doctor"
  ```
- Updated Cliffy to v1.0.0-rc.4 (fixes import assertion issues)

---

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery: Cliffy Version Compatibility
**Issue**: v1.0.0-rc.3 had import assertion deprecation errors
**Solution**: Upgraded to v1.0.0-rc.4
**Location**: All Cliffy imports updated

### Discovery: Logger Already Exists
**Found**: `scripts/utils/logger.ts` already implemented
**Features**:
- Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Color-coded output
- Progress and section helpers
- Environment variable configuration

---

## Verification Results

### CLI Help System Working
```bash
$ deno task cli --help
# Shows: all commands, global options, examples ✓

$ deno task scan --help
# Shows: scan options, examples ✓

$ deno task query --help
# Shows: query options, templates, examples ✓
```

### Command Registration
- ✅ All commands accessible via `deno task [command]`
- ✅ Help text displays correctly
- ✅ Options parse correctly
- ✅ Examples shown in help

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Old `deno run -A scripts/commands/scan.ts` still works
- ✅ Old `deno run -A scripts/commands/query.ts` still works
- ✅ Can migrate gradually to CLI router

## Context Network Impact

### What Future Sessions Can Do

**Phase 2: Utilities**
- Read `architecture/tooling_architecture.md` for utility layer design
- Reference `planning/typescript-agent-backlog.md` for Phase 1.3 tasks
- Implement file-hash, enhanced config utilities
- ~1-2 hours work

**Phase 3: Watch System**
- Read `architecture/command_reference.md` for watch command spec
- Reference `decisions/adr_002_deno_node_runtime_split.md` for Deno patterns
- Implement Deno.watchFs-based file watching
- ~2-3 hours work

**Phase 4+: Any Phase**
- Context network has complete architecture
- All decisions documented with rationale
- Discovery records explain existing code
- Location index provides code navigation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Context Network Pattern**: Perfect for breaking work into sessions
2. **Discovery Records**: Capturing implementation insights invaluable
3. **Location Indexes**: Line numbers make code navigation easy
4. **ADRs**: Documenting "why" prevents future confusion
5. **Cliffy Framework**: Excellent for CLI development

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Cliffy Version**: RC.3 had deprecation errors, RC.4 fixed
2. **Import Paths**: Had to use full URLs, not import map shortcuts
3. **Logger Already Existed**: Good surprise, but needed to verify

### Improvements for Next Session
1. Check for existing utilities before planning to create them
2. Test Cliffy integration earlier to catch version issues
3. Consider native Kuzu bindings for better performance
