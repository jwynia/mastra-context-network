# TypeScript LLM Agent Project Context Network

## Location
The context network for this project is located at: ./context-network/

## Purpose
This context network contains all planning documents, architecture decisions, design discussions, and team coordination information for TypeScript LLM agent projects built with the Mastra framework and OpenRouter. It serves as a specialized template for starting new agent projects with built-in LLM management and navigation capabilities, addressing the unique challenges of agent development including model selection, tool integration, workflow orchestration, and rapid AI ecosystem evolution.

## Usage Guidelines
- ALL planning documents, architecture diagrams, and design discussions MUST be stored within the context network
- Do NOT place planning or architecture documents in the project root
- Agent files outside the context network should only be files consumed by Mastra framework, deployment tools, or end users
- Agent code, configuration, and implementation files belong in the app/ directory, not in the context network

## Navigation
See the context network's navigation guide at ./context-network/discovery.md
