## Content

### Project Overview

The TypeScript LLM Agent Context Network is a specialized template for building intelligent TypeScript agents using the Mastra framework with OpenRouter as the model provider. It provides a structured approach to managing the complex web of decisions, designs, and domain knowledge that underlies LLM agent development, while maintaining clear separation between planning artifacts (context network) and implementation code (app/ directory).

### Vision Statement

To accelerate the development of intelligent TypeScript agents by creating a comprehensive knowledge framework that bridges human developers, AI capabilities, and agent architecture, enabling teams to build sophisticated, reliable, and maintainable LLM-powered applications using Mastra and OpenRouter.

### Mission Statement

The TypeScript LLM Agent Context Network template provides development teams with a structured knowledge management system that captures agent design patterns, LLM integration strategies, tool composition approaches, and workflow orchestration techniques, facilitating rapid development of intelligent agents while preserving institutional knowledge about agent architecture and LLM best practices.

### Project Objectives

1. Provide a specialized context network structure optimized for Mastra-based LLM agent development
2. Establish clear patterns for documenting agent architecture decisions, tool integrations, and workflow designs
3. Create navigation paths tailored to agent development roles and LLM integration tasks
4. Enable effective collaboration between human developers and AI agents in building intelligent systems
5. Reduce knowledge silos around agent design patterns, LLM configurations, and tool compositions
6. Document decision-making processes for the rapidly evolving LLM and agent ecosystem
7. Preserve institutional knowledge about Mastra framework usage and OpenRouter integration
8. Establish best practices for agent memory management, conversation handling, and workflow orchestration

### Success Criteria

1. Reduced time to first functional agent for new developers
2. Decreased frequency of "archaeology" requests about agent design decisions
3. Improved documentation coverage of agent components, tools, and workflows
4. Higher decision traceability for LLM model selection and configuration choices
5. Increased documentation update frequency relative to agent code changes
6. Greater developer confidence in building and modifying intelligent agents
7. Better stakeholder understanding of agent capabilities and limitations
8. Reduction in repeated LLM integration and agent architecture mistakes
9. Improved agent response quality and consistency
10. Enhanced workflow completion rates and error handling

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Context network structure specialized for Mastra-based LLM agent development
- Templates for agent architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Agent component and tool documentation patterns
- LLM integration and OpenRouter configuration templates
- Agent workflow orchestration and memory management strategies
- Navigation guides for agent development roles and LLM integration workflows
- Integration patterns with Mastra framework components and agent structures
- Maintenance strategies for keeping documentation in sync with agent code
- Model selection decision templates (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.)
- TypeScript configuration optimized for agent development
- Agent deployment and environment configuration guidance
- Tool composition and integration strategy documentation
- Workflow design patterns and step orchestration guides
- Memory persistence and conversation management approaches
- Agent testing and evaluation methodologies

#### Out of Scope

- Actual TypeScript agent implementation code (belongs in app/ directory)
- Specific Mastra boilerplate or starter agent code
- Pre-configured LLM model fine-tuning or training
- Specific testing framework implementations for agents
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline configurations
- Specific project management methodologies
- Package.json files or node_modules (belongs in app/ directory)
- Custom LLM model development or hosting infrastructure

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Agent Developers | Use the context network alongside TypeScript agent development | LLM agent development teams |
| Agent Architects | Document agent architectural decisions and system design | Agent architecture teams |
| Technical Leads | Ensure alignment between context network and agent implementation | Agent development team leads |
| New Team Members | Learn about agent development through the context network | Onboarding agent developers |
| AI Agents | Navigate and update the context network based on agent interactions | LLM assistants with agent knowledge |
| DevOps Engineers | Reference agent deployment and environment configuration decisions | Infrastructure teams |
| Product Managers | Understand agent capabilities and limitations for feature planning | Product management teams |
| LLM Engineers | Optimize model selection and configuration for agent performance | ML/AI engineering teams |

### Timeline

This is a template project without specific timeline milestones. Each Node-TypeScript implementation will have its own timeline.

### Constraints

- Must work with Mastra framework architecture and capabilities
- Should be compatible with OpenRouter API limitations and rate limits
- Must be TypeScript and LLM agent ecosystem focused
- Should not require specialized tools beyond text editors, LLM agents, and TypeScript tooling
- Must maintain separation between context network and app/ directory
- Should work with common TypeScript development environments
- Must respect LLM token limits and context windows
- Should be cost-conscious regarding OpenRouter API usage
- Must handle LLM response variability and error conditions

### Assumptions

- Development teams will maintain discipline in separating planning from implementation artifacts
- LLM agents will have sufficient context window to process relevant parts of the network
- Teams will regularly update the context network alongside agent code changes
- The context network will be stored in the same repository as the agent code or in a linked repository
- OpenRouter will maintain stable API access and model availability
- Mastra framework will continue to evolve with backward compatibility
- Teams have access to appropriate LLM models through OpenRouter for their use cases
- Developers have basic understanding of LLM concepts and agent architecture

### Risks

- Context network may become outdated if not maintained alongside agent code
- Teams may struggle with the discipline of separating planning from implementation
- LLM context limitations may restrict the ability to process the entire network
- Over-documentation could slow down agent development velocity
- Under-documentation could reduce the value of the context network
- OpenRouter API changes or model deprecations could impact agent functionality
- LLM response variability could make agent behavior unpredictable
- Cost overruns from inefficient LLM usage patterns
- Agent security vulnerabilities from improper prompt handling
- Performance issues from suboptimal tool composition or workflow design
