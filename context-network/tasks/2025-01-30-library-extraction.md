# Task: Library Extraction and Kuzu Client Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Summary
Completed Phase 1 of the TypeScript Agent Development Environment by extracting library modules and fixing critical Kuzu database client issues.

## Work Completed

### 1. Library Module Extraction
- Created `scripts/lib/ast-analyzer.ts` - TypeScript AST analysis using ts-morph
- Created `scripts/lib/kuzu-client.ts` - Kuzu graph database client
- Created `scripts/lib/duckdb-client.ts` - DuckDB analytics client
- Updated `scripts/commands/scan.ts` to use new library modules

### 2. Fixed Critical Kuzu Client Issues

#### Problem Discovered
The Kuzu client wasn't executing queries programmatically, though direct CLI queries worked.

#### Root Causes Found
1. **Path mismatch**: Environment variables had `/workspace/` but actual path was `/workspaces/mastra-context-network`
2. **Missing semicolons**: Cypher queries require semicolons for termination
3. **Missing relationship tables**: MEMBER_OF and CALLS tables didn't exist in schema
4. **Node.js exec issues**: Process execution wasn't properly handling Kuzu CLI

#### Solutions Implemented
1. Fixed path handling in `scripts/utils/config.ts`:
   - Added fixPath() function to convert `/workspace/` to relative paths
   - Lines 40-48 in config.ts

2. Added semicolons to all CREATE queries:
   - Symbol creation: line 217 in kuzu-client.ts
   - Type creation: line 244 in kuzu-client.ts
   - Relationship creation: lines 281-284 in kuzu-client.ts

3. Created missing relationship tables in Kuzu

### 3. Verification Results
Successfully scanned 7 TypeScript files:
- **120 symbols** extracted and stored in Kuzu
- **15 types** stored in Kuzu
- **94 MEMBER_OF relationships** created
- **2 CALLS relationships** detected
- **7 file metrics** stored in DuckDB

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery: Kuzu Database Path Issue
- **Location**: `scripts/utils/config.ts:42-53`
- **What**: Environment variables set absolute paths starting with `/workspace/`
- **Why it matters**: Caused all programmatic Kuzu operations to fail silently
- **Solution**: Path normalization in config loader

### Discovery: Kuzu Query Termination
- **Location**: `scripts/lib/kuzu-client.ts:217,244,281-284`
- **What**: Kuzu requires semicolons to terminate statements when executed via CLI
- **Why it matters**: Queries appeared to succeed but didn't actually execute
- **Solution**: Added semicolons to all generated Cypher queries

### Discovery: DuckDB Schema Mismatch
- **Location**: `scripts/lib/duckdb-client.ts:22-35`
- **What**: file_metrics table had different columns than expected
- **Why it matters**: Insert operations were failing with column not found errors
- **Solution**: Updated FileMetrics interface to match actual schema

## Technical Debt Identified
1. Kuzu client still uses temp files for query execution (performance impact)
2. Import node insertion not implemented (Import table doesn't exist in schema)
3. Some relationship types (CALLS) not fully captured from AST

## Next Steps
- Phase 2.1: Create CLI router with Cliffy
- Phase 2.2: Implement query system
- Phase 3: File watching and incremental updates
