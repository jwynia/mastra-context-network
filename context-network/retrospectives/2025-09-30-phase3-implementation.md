# Retrospective: Phase 3 Watch System Implementation - 2025-09-30

## Task Summary

### Objective
Implement file watching system with incremental scanning (Phase 3.1 & 3.2 from backlog):
- File watcher using Deno.watchFs with debouncing
- Incremental change detection via hash comparison
- CLI integration for watch command
- Foundation for database integration

### Outcome
**Successfully completed Phase 3.1 and foundational Phase 3.2**:
- ✅ Debouncing utility (100% test coverage)
- ✅ Incremental scanner (100% test coverage)
- ✅ File watcher with pattern filtering
- ✅ Watch command CLI
- ✅ 20 new unit tests (68 total, 100% pass rate)
- ⏳ Database integration deferred (documented as next step)

### Key Learnings
1. **TDD drives clean architecture**: Writing tests first forced clear separation of concerns
2. **Deno.watchFs is excellent**: Async iterator pattern works beautifully
3. **Debouncing essential**: Prevents duplicate processing from rapid file saves
4. **Pattern matching complex**: Simple regex works for MVP, but proper glob library needed
5. **Manual testing honest**: Integration testing via manual verification catches real issues

## Patterns and Insights

### Recurring Themes

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Pure logic (debouncer, scanner) separated from integration (watcher, command)
   - Enables 100% test coverage for business logic
   - Makes integration code simple wrappers

2. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Writing tests first drove better API design
   - Caught edge cases early (timer reset, empty states, multiple flushes)
   - Gave confidence to refactor

3. **Platform API Quality**:
   - Deno.watchFs excellent (async iterator)
   - Signal handling straightforward
   - Web Crypto API fast and reliable

4. **Defer Optimization**:
   - Simple pattern matching sufficient for MVP
   - In-memory state adequate for initial implementation
   - Database integration separated into next phase

### Process Improvements

1. **Discovery Records are Valuable**:
   - Architecture discovery document prevents future questioning
   - Location index saves time finding code
   - Should create these for all major features

2. **Line Numbers in Documentation**:
   - Extremely helpful for navigation
   - Should be standard in all location indexes
   - Makes code review and debugging faster

3. **Retrospective Process**:
   - Taking time to document decisions pays off
   - Capturing "why" as important as "what"
   - Context network updates should happen immediately after implementation

### Knowledge Gaps Identified

1. **Pattern Matching Library**:
   - Gap: Don't know best practices for glob patterns in Deno
   - Action: Should research `@std/path/globToRegExp` usage
   - Impact: Would improve pattern matching quality

2. **Regex Performance**:
   - Gap: Don't know cost of regex compilation in hot path
   - Action: Should benchmark and implement caching if needed
   - Impact: Could affect watch performance on large projects

3. **Database Integration Patterns**:
   - Gap: Best way to persist file hashes in DuckDB
   - Action: Need to design schema and update patterns
   - Impact: Required for Phase 3.2 completion

---

## Follow-up Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Implement Pattern Caching** (Priority: Medium, Effort: ~15 min)
   - **Why**: Performance hot spot in file watcher
   - **What**: Add `Map<string, RegExp>` to cache compiled patterns
   - **Where**: `file-watcher.ts:matchPattern()`
   - **Benefit**: Eliminates repeated regex compilation

2. **Extract Pattern Matcher** (Priority: Medium, Effort: ~30 min)
   - **Why**: Code duplication between FileWatcher and watch command
   - **What**: Create `scripts/utils/pattern-matcher.ts` using `@std/path/globToRegExp`
   - **Where**: New utility, replace logic in both files
   - **Benefit**: Consistency and proper glob support

3. **Remove Duplicate Function** (Priority: Low, Effort: ~5 min)
   - **Why**: Unnecessary wrapper in watch command
   - **What**: Remove `getCurrentHashes()`, call `getInitialHashes()` directly
   - **Where**: `watch.ts:168-173`
   - **Benefit**: Reduces code complexity

### Short-term (This Week)

4. **Complete Database Integration** (Priority: High, Effort: ~2-3 hours)
   - **Why**: Completes Phase 3.2
   - **What**:
     - Create `file_hashes` table in DuckDB
     - Load previous hashes on watch start
     - Update hashes after successful scan
   - **Where**: `scripts/commands/watch.ts` and new DB schema
   - **Benefit**: Persistent state across watch sessions

5. **Refactor Scanner for Incremental Mode** (Priority: High, Effort: ~2-3 hours)
   - **Why**: Enables actual incremental scanning
   - **What**:
     - Add `incremental` option to `scan.ts`
     - Accept file list parameter
     - Update only changed symbols
   - **Where**: `scripts/commands/scan.ts`
   - **Benefit**: Complete watch system functionality

### Medium-term (Next Sprint)

6. **Add Git SHA Tracking** (Priority: Medium, Effort: ~1 hour)
   - **Why**: Enables Phase 3.3 (git hooks)
   - **What**: Store git SHA with each scan in file_hashes
   - **Where**: Use existing `git.ts` utility, update schema
   - **Benefit**: Historical queries, commit-triggered scans

7. **Create Discovery Record Template** (Priority: Low, Effort: ~1 hour)
   - **Why**: Standardize discovery record creation
   - **What**: Template file with sections and examples
   - **Where**: `.context-network/templates/discovery-record.md`
   - **Benefit**: Faster, more consistent documentation
