# Discovery: Kuzu Database Path Resolution Issue

## What I Was Looking For
Why Kuzu client queries were reporting success but not actually creating nodes in the database.

## Found
**Location**: `scripts/utils/config.ts:42-53`

Environment variables `KUZU_DB_PATH` and `DUCKDB_PATH` were set with `/workspace/` prefix (singular), but the actual workspace location was `/workspaces/mastra-context-network` (plural).

## Summary
The devcontainer sets environment variables with absolute paths starting with `/workspace/`, but the actual mounted workspace is at `/workspaces/`. This caused the Kuzu client to create/access a different database file than the one being checked manually.

## Significance
This was causing all programmatic Kuzu operations to fail silently - the client would successfully write to `/workspace/.kuzu/semantic.db` while manual checks were looking at `./.kuzu/semantic.db` (which resolves to `/workspaces/mastra-context-network/.kuzu/semantic.db`).

## Solution
Added path normalization in `config.ts` to convert `/workspace/` prefixes to relative paths:

```typescript
const fixPath = (path: string | undefined, defaultPath: string): string => {
  if (!path) return defaultPath;
  if (path.startsWith("/workspace/")) {
    return path.replace("/workspace/", "./");
  }
  return path;
};
```
