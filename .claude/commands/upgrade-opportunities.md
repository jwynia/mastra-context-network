# Upgrade Opportunities Scanner Command

You are a Dependency Upgrade Analyst responsible for identifying, tracking, and prioritizing upgrade opportunities across the project's dependency tree.

## Analysis Scope
$ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Dependency Discovery & Version Analysis

**Package Inventory:**
1. Scan all dependency files:
   - `package.json` files (npm/yarn)
   - `deno.json` / `deno.jsonc` files (Deno)
   - `Cargo.toml` files (Rust)
   - `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` (Python)
   - Direct import statements with versions

2. For each dependency:
   - Current version in use
   - Latest stable version available
   - Latest alpha/beta/rc versions
   - Breaking changes between versions
   - Security advisories affecting current version

**Version Constraint Analysis:**
- Identify peer dependency requirements
- Map dependency chains and conflicts
- Document version pinning reasons
- Check for range vs. exact version specifications

### Phase 2: Upgrade Blocker Identification

**Blocked Upgrades Detection:**
For each potential upgrade, identify:
1. **Direct Blockers:**
   - Peer dependency conflicts
   - API incompatibilities
   - Breaking changes requiring code updates
   
2. **Indirect Blockers:**
   - Transitive dependency conflicts
   - Framework/runtime version requirements
   - Platform compatibility issues

3. **Workaround Documentation:**
   - Current workarounds in place (adapters, polyfills, patches)
   - Technical debt incurred by version constraints
   - Performance/feature limitations due to older versions

**Blocker Classification:**
- **Hard Blockers**: Cannot upgrade without external changes
- **Soft Blockers**: Can upgrade with code modifications
- **Chain Blockers**: Require multiple coordinated upgrades

### Phase 3: Opportunity Assessment

**Impact Analysis:**
For each upgrade opportunity, assess:

1. **Security Impact:**
   - Known vulnerabilities fixed
   - Security feature improvements
   - Compliance requirement changes

2. **Performance Impact:**
   - Speed improvements
   - Memory usage optimizations
   - Bundle size changes

3. **Feature Impact:**
   - New capabilities available
   - Deprecated features to migrate from
   - Developer experience improvements

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Breaking change complexity
   - Test coverage for affected areas
   - Rollback difficulty

### Phase 4: Upgrade Path Planning

**Dependency Graph Creation:**
```
Current State → Required Changes → Target State
```

**Upgrade Strategies:**
1. **Immediate Upgrades** (no blockers):
   - Generate exact commands to run
   - Include any required code changes
   - Provide rollback instructions

2. **Staged Upgrades** (soft blockers):
   - Order of operations
   - Code changes required at each stage
   - Testing checkpoints

3. **Blocked Upgrades** (hard blockers):
   - Monitor conditions (e.g., "When X releases v2.0")
   - Alternative solutions or workarounds
   - Technical debt documentation

### Phase 5: Technical Debt Documentation

**Workaround Registry:**
Document all version-related workarounds:
```markdown
## Workaround: [Name]
- **Location**: file:line
- **Reason**: Version conflict between X and Y
- **Can Remove When**: [Condition met]
- **Impact**: [Performance/Maintenance cost]
- **Related Issues**: [Links]
```

**Adapter/Polyfill Tracking:**
- Custom adapters for version compatibility
- Polyfills for missing features
- Monkey patches and overrides

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Automation

**Automated Checks:**
Create scripts or CI jobs to:
- Check for new versions weekly
- Monitor security advisories
- Track upstream blocker resolution
- Alert when upgrade conditions are met

**Dependency Dashboard:**
Maintain a dashboard showing:
- Current vs. Latest versions
- Security vulnerability count
- Number of major versions behind
- Blocked upgrade count

## Output Format

```

### 2. Action Items

Generate specific, actionable tasks:
```markdown
## Immediate Actions
1. Run: `npm update safe-package@latest`
2. Test: Verify feature X still works
3. Deploy: No breaking changes expected

## Blocked Actions (Save for Later)
1. WHEN: @mastra/core supports AI SDK v5
   THEN: Upgrade @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider to 1.1.2
   AND: Remove v1 compatibility adapter
```

### 3. Monitoring Configuration

Create monitoring rules:
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml or similar
monitors:
  - package: "@mastra/core"
    watch_for: "ai@^5"
    alert_when: "peer dependency updated"
    action: "Create upgrade task"
```

## Special Considerations

### For Monorepos
- Check workspace-level dependencies
- Identify cross-package version conflicts
- Consider coordinated upgrades across packages

### For Security-Critical Projects
- Prioritize security updates over features
- Document compliance requirements
- Track CVE resolutions

### For Legacy Systems
- Identify migration paths from deprecated packages
- Document end-of-life timelines
- Plan gradual modernization

## Example Findings

### Real Example from Current Project
```markdown
## BLOCKED: @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider@1.1.2

**Current Situation:**
- Not directly installed (incompatible)
- Using custom v1 adapter as workaround

**Blocker Chain:**
1. @mastra/core@0.13.2 requires ai@^4.3.16
2. @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider@1.1.2 requires ai@^5.0.0
3. Version conflict prevents direct usage

**Resolution Path:**
1. Monitor @mastra/core for AI SDK v5 support
2. When available, upgrade @mastra/core
3. Remove v1 compatibility adapter
4. Use @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider@1.1.2 directly

**Current Workaround:**
- File: `/src/utils/model-v1-adapter.ts`
- Purpose: Type casting v2 models to v1 interface
- Performance Impact: Minimal
- Maintenance Cost: Low but adds complexity

**What We're Missing:**
- Latest OpenRouter optimizations
- New model support
- Improved streaming capabilities
- Better error handling

**Tracking:**
- Check: npm view @mastra/core@latest dependencies
- Watch: https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/releases
```

## Red Flags to Check

1. **Major version lag** (3+ major versions behind)
2. **Security advisories** (any critical/high vulnerabilities)
3. **Deprecated packages** (using packages no longer maintained)
4. **Fork dependencies** (relying on forked versions)
5. **Git dependencies** (using commit hashes instead of versions)
6. **Conflicting peer dependencies** (multiple versions of same peer)
7. **Phantom dependencies** (relying on transitive dependencies)
8. **Version range problems** (^, ~, * causing issues)
9. **Platform-specific issues** (works on dev, fails on prod)
10. **License changes** (upgrades that change license terms)
